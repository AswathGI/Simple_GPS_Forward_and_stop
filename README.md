# Simple_GPS_Forward_and_stop
This code is for MonsterBorg Robot which uses ThunderBorg Motor Driver. This program gets GPS Coordinates from the Satellite and performs simple movements like move forward or stop. The robot also gets its surrounding data using the distance sensor and stops if there is any obstacle in-front of it  (less than 50cm).
